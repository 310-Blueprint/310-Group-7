/*
 * AuthButton — the yellow primary action.
 *
 * Defaults to type="submit" since that's what every auth form needs; pass
 * type="button" for anything that shouldn't submit a form.
 *
 * `className` is the wrapper's spacing. It defaults to how the button sits in
 * an auth card, since all three pages want the same thing — pass your own to
 * override. The button's own look is fixed here so it can't drift per page.
